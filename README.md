Snake is a simple game. This is Snake written for JavaScript.
I did it as an example of a JavaScript game in a browser. It uses fomr HTML5 Canvas stuff.

There is a good deal of work that still needs to be done to make this a good example of how to do a project in JavaScript.
- Refactor into clean Objects
- Better UI presenation
- Better instructions

This was writen in response to a code challenge, so it has some specifics in it. It works under those conditions. I'll fix the rest later.
