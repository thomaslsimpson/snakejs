			<p>
			Snake is a simple game. Using the cursor keys, direct your snake to eat the 
			yellow blocks. Avoid everything else. (Even yourself, except in Easy mode.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Difficulty</b><br>
			Higher difficulty means a higher score. But watch out for the extra blocks 
			that put in your path.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Controls</b><br>
				<ul>
					<li>SPACE BAR: Paused the game.
					<li>Cursor keys: move the snake.
					<li>Toggle Fullscreen Button: change into and out of full screen mode.
					<li>Block Wide/High: change the number of blocks on the field.
				</ul>
